In this lab4 SQL file, the commands will accurately sift through the database and run from top to bottom. The first couple of lines of SQL are meant to update my tables to make them able to give results to the questions within the document.
But I did reuse data from my tables, just made some tweaks in the first lines of SQL code. Then I get into the actual queries that the assigment ask for, and they are separated by line breaks or extra line spaces. The last two lines of code are the code from ChatGPT
and Copilot. ChatGPT is the first code, and Copilot is the second one.
